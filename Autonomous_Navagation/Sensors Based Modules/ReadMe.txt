# Autonomous Vehicle Sensor Integration

This repository focuses on the integration of various sensors for autonomous vehicles. It provides a framework for incorporating sensor data into an autonomous vehicle system to enable perception, decision-making, and control. The goal is to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's surroundings for safe and efficient navigation.

## Sensors

The following sensors are commonly used in autonomous vehicles:

- **LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging sensors emit laser beams and measure the time it takes for the beams to return after hitting objects. This data provides accurate 3D point cloud representations of the environment.

- **Camera**: Cameras capture images of the surrounding environment and are crucial for tasks such as object detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition. They provide rich visual information for perception algorithms.

- **Radar**: Radar sensors use radio waves to detect objects and measure their distance, velocity, and angle. They are particularly useful for detecting objects in adverse weather conditions.

- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Ultrasonic sensors emit sound waves and measure the time it takes for the waves to reflect off objects. These sensors are commonly used for proximity sensing and parking assistance.

- **GPS**: Global Positioning System sensors determine the vehicle's position on the Earth's surface using signals from satellites. They provide important localization information for navigation.

- **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Units consist of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. They measure linear and angular motion, providing information about the vehicle's orientation and movement.

## Integration Steps

To integrate sensors into an autonomous vehicle system, follow these general steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the sensors to the vehicle's onboard computer or controller. Ensure proper power supply and wiring.

2. **Sensor Calibration**: Calibrate each sensor to ensure accurate measurements and alignment with the vehicle's coordinate system. This step is crucial for sensor fusion and accurate perception.

3. **Data Acquisition**: Develop code or use existing libraries to capture data from each sensor. This may involve accessing camera feeds, LiDAR point clouds, radar measurements, GPS data, or IMU readings.

4. **Sensor Fusion**: Combine data from multiple sensors to create a comprehensive understanding of the environment. Sensor fusion algorithms, such as Kalman filters or particle filters, are commonly used to integrate sensor data and generate a consistent perception of the surroundings.

5. **Perception Algorithms**: Process the fused sensor data using computer vision, deep learning, and signal processing techniques. Implement algorithms for object detection, lane detection, semantic segmentation, and other perception tasks.

6. **Localization**: Utilize sensor data, especially GPS and IMU readings, for localization. Implement algorithms for estimating the vehicle's position and orientation within a global or local coordinate system.

7. **Mapping**: Generate maps of the environment using sensor data. This can involve creating 3D maps from LiDAR point clouds or building occupancy grids based on sensor measurements.

8. **Path Planning and Control**: Use the perception and mapping results to plan safe and efficient paths for the vehicle. Implement decision-making algorithms and controllers to guide the vehicle's motion based on the planned path.

9. **Validation and Testing**: Validate the sensor integration and perception algorithms through simulation or real-world testing. Evaluate the performance of the autonomous vehicle system in various scenarios and refine the algorithms as needed.
